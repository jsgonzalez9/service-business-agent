After your property details are verified, we send a contract, and once signed, we match your property with buyers and move to closing."},{intent:"FAQ_PROCESS",question:"How long does it take to close?",response:"Closing typically takes 14–30 days depending on inspections, title, and buyer readiness."},{intent:"FAQ_CONTRACT",question:"Do I need an inspection?",response:"We buy as‑is.

Let’s walk through the numbers and see if adjustments make sense."},{intent:"FAQ_CONTRACT",question:"Do I need to put down earnest money?",response:"No. As the seller, you do not provide earnest money.

Any repairs are factored into our offer — you don’t need to spend upfront."},{intent:"FAQ_TRUST",question:"Are you a wholesaler?",response:"Yes, we operate as compliant investors/wholesalers.

I’m happy to answer questions so you can decide what’s best for your situation."},{intent:"NEGOTIATION",question:"I’m too busy right now",response:"Understood. We can schedule a quick call or text at a convenient time for you."},{intent:"FAQ_GENERAL",question:"Do I need to paint or fix small things?",response:"No — we buy as‑is, including minor issues. No prep needed."},{intent:"FAQ_GENERAL",question:"What about big repairs?",response:"We account for major repairs in our offer, so you won’t have to fix them first."},{intent:"FAQ_PROCESS",question:"Do I get multiple offers?",response:"Yes. We broadcast to vetted buyers and help you evaluate the strongest offers."},{intent:"FAQ_PROCESS",question:"How do I know which offer is best?",response:"We compare offers by price, terms, and buyer reliability to help you choose confidently."},{intent:"FAQ_FEES",question:"What is an assignment fee?",response:"It’s the fee paid to the wholesaler for securing the contract and finding a buyer."},{intent:"FAQ_CONTRACT",question:"How long is your offer valid?",response:"Offers are typically valid 48–72 hours to give you time to review and decide."},{intent:"FAQ_PROCESS",question:"I need to sell fast",response:"We specialize in quick closings and can often close in 14–21 days."},{intent:"FAQ_PROCESS",question:"Can I wait longer?",response:"Yes, we can accommodate your timeline.

Repair estimates are built into the offer so the number is realistic."},{intent:"FAQ_GENERAL",question:"How will you contact me?",response:"We use SMS and phone, aligned to your preferences."},{intent:"FAQ_TRUST",question:"Is my info confidential?",response:"Yes. Your information is kept confidential and only used for evaluating the property and closing."},{intent:"FAQ_FEES",question:"Are there any hidden fees?",response:"No hidden fees. Our process is transparent, and you won’t pay out‑of‑pocket."},{intent:"FAQ_GENERAL",question:"I’m moving out of state",response:"We can work remotely and handle documents online with the title company."},{intent:"FAQ_PROCESS",question:"Can we close same‑day?",response:"Rarely; proper processing is needed. 1–2 weeks is typical, though we expedite when possible."},{intent:"FAQ_GENERAL",question:"Do I need a real estate agent?",response:"No agent is required — we handle the purchase directly."},{intent:"FAQ_GENERAL",question:"I have a bankruptcy, can I sell?",response:"Yes.
